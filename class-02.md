## html (tags)
#### HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
#### They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation like:
- ``` <q> ``` The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.
- ``` <ins> ``` The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document
- ``` <b> ``` make characters appear bold.
