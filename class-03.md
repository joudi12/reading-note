#### what is a script?
###### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.Statements should end with a semicolon.
#### what is Javascript consist of?
- Statment
- Comments
- Varialble
#### if , else statment 
##### Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
##### Example
##### Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:

``if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
}``

### The else Statement
#### Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
#### Example
#### If the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":

``if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";``
  
  
### SWITCH STATEMENTS 
#### A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 
#### example 
``switch (level) {
case 'One ':
title= 'Level 1 ' ;
break;
case 'Two':
tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ;
break;
case ' Three' :
title = 'Level 3' ;
break ;
default :
title= 'Test';
break;``


### JavaScript Loops
#### Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
#### example 
`` var i;
for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}``


#### Different Kinds of Loops:
- for - loops through a block of code a number of times
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
