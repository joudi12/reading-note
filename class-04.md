## html links
##### Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### Opening Links in a New Window
##### If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the ``target`` attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
##### like : ``<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">``
##### **If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs** 
## Building Blocks
##### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in itsown box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
- Inline elements
- Block-level elements
## Controlling the Position of Elements
- Normal flow
1- Floating Elements

- Relative Positioning
1- position:relative
- Absolute positioning
1- position:absolute
- Fixed Positioning 
1- position:fixed
- Floating Elements
1- z-index
 ## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?
 #### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

 - calling function
 ## HOW MEMORY & VARIABLES WORK
 ##### Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.
