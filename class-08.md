### Screen Sizes
##### Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
### Screen Resolution
##### Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens
#### fixed Width Layouts
##### To create a fixed width layout, the width of the main boxes on a page will usually be specified in pixels (and sometimes their height, too)
#### Aliquid layout
##### The liquid layout uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.
### Layout Grids
##### Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
