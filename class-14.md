### Do you ever wonder why some teams work well together and others don’t? What’s the secret ingredient – is it the people, their personalities, education, background, gender, or experience?

#### Teams tend to be more innovative, recognize mistakes more quickly, and come up with bettersolutions to problems. In a 2015 Yale study, executives say that profitability increases whenworkers are persuaded to collaborate more. And with better results comes higher job satisfaction, so there’s strong evidence for the effectiveness of teams.

#### it is also important to keep a friendly atmosphere betwean the teammates instead of the compition on the leadership, also not to criticize and judjing each other,teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work.

#### Collaborating on a project creates an enthusiasm for learning that solitary work usually lacks. Being able to share discoveries with the rest of your team excites employees and fosters both individual and team knowledge.

#### Working together lets employees build on the talents of their teammates. While your strength may be creative thinking, a coworker might shine in organization and planning. Do not hesitate to share your abilities with the team.

### Let's breakdown what the Google research team found.

1. Psychological Safety

#### Psychological safety is about environment. It's about creating a safe culture in which team members feel "safe" enough to take an interpersonal risk. Encouraging team members to voice their opinions, even if it goes against the group, can be risky. However, teams that exhibit high psychological safety encourage risk-taking. Plus, when team members take risks, they aren't viewed as disruptive, disrespectful or incompetent.

2. Dependability
#### Dependability is about accountability. It's about reliability. It's about trust.

#### When everyone on the team is accountable, reliable and trustworthy, the team succeeds.

#### How many teams have you been on when one person shirks responsibility? We've all seen it before. A team can crumble when even one person can't be trusted to do the work. On a highly dependable team, every team member can trust that high quality work will be produced on time.

3. Structure and clarity

#### All teams need structure and clarity, so long as rules are not too rigid that they stifle progress.

#### When teams have structure and clarity, there are specific and clear performance standards and directives for the team to work and achieve. With these inputs, team members understand their function, purpose, expectations and performance objectives.
4. Meaning

#### No one wants to work in a job or organization without meaning or purpose. So, you can imagine how a team member feels working on a team without either meaning or purpose. There are many ways to create meaning within the construct of a team. For example, you can create meaning in the work itself or in the final product.

5. Impact

#### Work is about creating value and impact for others. Team members want to know - from their subjective perspective - that the work they are doing is creating impact. Also, team members want to feel that the team's work is helping to advance the organization's overall goals, mission and impact. Reserving time for each team member to reflect on their impact can be a valuable exercise to further purpose and meaning as well.
