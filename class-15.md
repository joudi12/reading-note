## Transforms
### With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.
### The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
### there alot of typ of transform and each type will do somthing like in the photo.

### One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.
### As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
### also there alot of type from transition and each type do somthing like :
1. Transition Demo
2. Transitional Property
3. Transition Duration
4. Transition Timing
### Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

1. Animation Name hint : Using the animation-name property alone isnâ€™t enough though. You also need to declare an animation-duration property and value so that the browser knows how long an animation should take to complete.
2. Animation Iteration 
3. Animation Direction hint : On top of being able to set the number of times an animation repeats, you may also declare the direction an animation completes using the animation-direction property. Values for the animation-direction property include normal, reverse, alternate, and alternate-reverse.
4. Animation Play State
5. Animation Fill Mode
